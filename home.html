					<h3>Special Offers</h3>
					<p>Appeal to customers with special offers.Customers feel special when they realize they are receiving an offer. This empowers the customer to spend more time on the site and buy products.Discounted products, slashed rates, holiday season offers, and mid-year sales are all ways to make more customers throng to your online fashion store.Seasons and customer segmentation plays a crucial role in enhancing sales for your online store. Customer segmentation helps to analyze what products a specific set of customers are most likely to buy. Once merchants have the data in hand, targeted campaigns can be implemented to make the customer arrive at a buying decision faster.The same with seasonal sales – run campaigns based on the seasons, as there’s a fashion for every phase.</p>

					<h3>Product Category</h3>
					<p>Help customers find what they are looking for, easily.If shoppers do not find the products they want to buy, they are not going to buy them. It is as simple as this. Also, not all visitors navigate the same way or have similar needs. The onus lies on merchants to create and provide a variety of enriching product options to ensure customers of any kind can quickly locate the products they desire.Using highly searched names for your product category will help both to increase your SEO rankings, and also for customers to search efficiently.Pro Tip: When you are organizing products, make sure they are not too broad.</p>

					<h3>Quick Time</h3>
					<p>Every second counts.The slower your site, the more chances of customers drifting away.Websites with more than three seconds of loading time lose 40% of their initial website visitors, and 52% of online shoppers say their loyalty towards a site is based on the loading time.Page loading time is an essential factor of any online store’s user experience, and even more critical when it comes to search engine rankings. Implement a design that loads all the assets quickly.Online stores (or any website) must be optimized. There are several tools available online to do the tasks for you. Let slow loading time not be a reason anymore for the customer to ditch your site.</p>
